# ACF
Assignment Cheater Finder

This is a simple python script that finds the longest common subsequence between two text files and hightlights them on both texts.
You can run it on a real example of cheating, to see the result you should run:

`sh example.sh`

Look into the example.sh file to see how to use the acf.py script.
