# Azra: An Assignment Cheater Finder

This is a simple python script that finds the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two text files and hightlights them on both texts.
You can run it on a real example of cheating using the text files submitted by two studens. To see the result for these given text files you can run:

`sh example.sh`

Look into the example.sh file to see how to use the acf.py script.

## How to interpret the output:
I would suggest look for the areas in both texts where there are matched characters (with the red color) with little or no unmatched (white colored) characters.
